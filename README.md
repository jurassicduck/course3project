# Getting and Cleaning Data Project

## Background
This is the course project for John Hopkins University's Getting and Cleaning Data Course. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the ability to collect and clean a data set. Detail information regarding this data source can be found [here] (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). Data can be downloaded [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).

## Instructions
Unzip the data files from the second link above and create an R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Submission
The following items need to be submitted for grading:

1. a tidy data set as described in the Project Instructions section.
2. a link to the Github repository with the R script for performing the analysis
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
